# Reflection

- What I liked: Did not learn of OOP in undergrad and it was nice to begin using it. It is a very powerful tool to have and let's us break down very complex problems into smaller pieces.


- Interesting: OOP in general is interesting. I am keen to use these tools on more complex problems!


- Confusing: Still unsure about the java keywords (private, static) that define the classes. Java syntax in general as well is not straightforward like python. Also broke down the code per specification but while researching online I found that ideally we need to use getValue methods which we're learning about now, but at the moment it's a little confusing.


- Challenging: The assignment is of appropriate difficulty, there are syntax challenges I ran into and other times I got stuck but that's the best way to learn, to get stuck and find the right resources, and figure out why and then how to fix it.


- Motivating: Once the code is put together and runs without issue its both rewarding and makes the solution we came up with seem so simple. I feel more comfortable with the language after using it and it does not seem as foreign as it did 2 weeks ago.
