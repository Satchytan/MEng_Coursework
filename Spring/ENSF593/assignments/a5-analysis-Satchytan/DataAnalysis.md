## Verification of statistics

To verify the correctness of the program's outputs, comparisons were made with alternate means such as Excel. The data analysis results were cross-checked by importing the same datasets into Excel and performing similar operations. This verification process ensured the accuracy and reliability of the program's calculations and outputs.

# Reflection

Liked: The ability to read data from CSV files using Java was interesting and useful. It provided a practical understanding of file handling and data manipulation in a real-world context.

Found interesting: Exploring the implementation of data structures like DataFrame and DataSeries was intriguing. It highlighted the power of organizing and analyzing data using structures and data series.

Challenging: Understanding what was required to be implemented in DataFrame and DataSeries was challenging. It took time to understand the methods required based on the setup of the given files.

Motivating: The ability to perform various statistical calculations on the data, such as finding the minimum, maximum, sum, and mean, was motivating. It showed the practical applications of data analysis and the potential insights that can be derived from the data.
