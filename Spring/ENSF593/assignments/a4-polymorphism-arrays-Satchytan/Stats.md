# Reflection

Liked/Interesting/Motivating:

- Clear objective and guidelines for the assignment
- More involvement with working with the GUI
- Useful programs
- Learning how to get the various classes to interact with one another and output something of value
	
Dislikes/Confusing/Challenging:

- Java syntax still a challenge in these assignments
- Stats program seemed less relevant to the focus of lectures and labs this week, but did include working with arrays and also reinforced learning through repetition
