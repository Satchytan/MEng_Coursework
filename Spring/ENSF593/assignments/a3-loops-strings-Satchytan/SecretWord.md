# Reflection

Liked: Implementing the logic for updating the displayed word based on the user's guess was interesting and satisfying.

Interesting: Designing the algorithm for the replaceChars(String, String, char) method to replace characters at specific indices was challenging but that made it rewarding once I figured out how to do it.

Confusing: The problem statement didn't provide instructions on how the GUI interacts with the SecretWord class but figuring that out was part of the challenge of the assignment.

Challenging: Took me some time to realize how to tell the program the user made a correct a guess, but the implementation ended up being very simple in the end --> if new value != old value.

Motivating: Was enjoyable to mess around with different inputs for both Newton and SecretWord to try and break the code, was motivating when it worked with all inputs.

Disliked: After doing them 3 times, I'm beginning to dread the reporting part of these assignments. I don't particularly enjoy the writing portion and uploading the images and linking each of them to the MD files is getting repetitive and feels more tedious than it is.
