# Lecture l05

## Goal: Program control statements (if-else, for, while) 
- Learn about if-else
- Learn about and practice the three loops structures in Java
- Use if-else and loops to implement algorithms
- Use if-else and loops to implement interactive CLI
- Learn about break and continue 
 

## Reading
Chapter 3 Program control statements
- 3.2 The if statement
- 3.4 The if-else if ladder
- 3.8 The for loop
- 3.14 The while loop
- 3.15 The do-while loop
- 3.17 Use break to exit a loop
- 3.21 Nested loops

## Warm-up
We would like to write a GUI that:
- Generates a password (String) of random characters
- Allows the user to choose the length of the password
- Characters are randomly chosen from `'A'` to `'Z'`.

We anticipate that our password generator might be used in other contexts. Therefore, we create two classes: `PasswordGenerator` and `RandomPasswordGUI`.

First, we focus on the UI. 
Create a class `RandomPasswordGUI` based on `GreeterGui.java` the contains the necessary UI elements. Add a method `generatePassword()` that takes the length as an argument and returns a String, for now always the same password.

## if-else and loops

- Show basic form of `if else`.
- Show basic form of `for`, `while` and `do-while` loops.
- Show nested loops.
- Show `break` and `continue`.



## Practice loops
Solve exercises in `SkiJump.java` (nested loops) and `Loops.java` (algorithms)

## Grade average
Using `InteractiveCLI` write a program that prompts the user to enter individual grades as `double` until the user decides to stop. Once all grades are entered, display the average grade.

Implement this program in a file `GradeAverage.java`.
